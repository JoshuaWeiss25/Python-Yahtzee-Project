this folder is where the pickle files for the scorekeeping goes. if this folder does not exist, the code will not work. it cannot create new folders.

old files will not be deleted, i don't have the knowhow to do that. however, files can and will be reused. at the begining of a game, the player 1 scorecard (and other neceesary player scorecards) will be overwritten and set to zero
